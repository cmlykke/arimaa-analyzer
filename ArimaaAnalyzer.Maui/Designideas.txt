On the board, pieces can now 
be dragged and dropped to any vanct square.

Board behavior can be changed through 
a BoardBehavior parameter class.

- create buttons that
reset a board position,
and a button that confirms the 
board position.

- make sure that the board 
uses the ArimaaEngineInterface 
sytax to save the currenct board position.

- Change the board position 
from a string to a tree structure that,
 to begin with,
perhaps should only have one branch 
per node. 

- toggle an enable/disable 
AI analysis toggle, that 
sends the poard position 
to the Ai, and sets the new board 
position according to the Ai.
This means that the board 
tree structure should tell the user that
the current board position is
an Ai position.
